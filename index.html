         <p> He was born without fully formed limbs. According to his autobiography, his mother refused to see him or hold him when the nurse held him in front of her, and she and her husband went out of the hospital and vomited from seeing their son with no limbs, but they eventually accepted the condition and understood it as "God's plan for their son."
             When he was seventeen years old, Vujicic's mother showed him a newspaper article about a woman praying with a severe disability; he then started to give talks at his prayer group. 
            ;Vujicic graduated from Griffith University at the age of 21 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, with a double major in accountancy and financial planning.
